# E-commerce Product Recommendation System

## Project Description

This **E-commerce Product Recommendation System** leverages machine learning algorithms to suggest personalized products to users based on their preferences, browsing history, and other user attributes. The system employs **collaborative filtering** and **content-based filtering** techniques to recommend items that are most likely to interest each user.

### Why it's important:
- **Personalization**: Enhances the user experience by providing tailored recommendations.
- **Increased Sales**: Helps in boosting conversion rates by suggesting relevant products.
- **Improved Engagement**: Encourages users to discover new products, increasing the time spent on the platform.

This project utilizes **scikit-learn**, **Pandas**, and **NumPy** for building and running the recommendation algorithms. The system is easy to set up, and you can generate personalized recommendations for users based on their past interactions with products.
